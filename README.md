# MSBD5001

The language of my program is python. The packages I called are numpy, pandas and sklearn.

In feature engineering phase, I constructed extra features by dividing some selected features by job number. It was demonstrated by experiments that such processing significantly improve the accuracy. In training phase, I leveraged Gradient Boosting Regression Tree.

validation.ipynb is used to conduct model selection. I split the data into training set and validation set to measure the performance of model with different parameters setting.

prediction.ipynb is used to train a model and make a predcition for test data.
